In this project, I aimed to apply my knowledge of Flexbox to create a layout. While the focus was on utilizing Flexbox for layout management, the design is not yet fully responsive. This project serves as a way for me to practice and refine my skills, with plans for further improvements to make it more adaptable across various devices in the future.
